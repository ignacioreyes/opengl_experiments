## Jelly!

2D simulation of some jelly. The model is a grid of vertices connected by springs. The evolution of the positions is computed with the Verlet method.

The base code was built following the OpenGL tutorial series from TheCherno https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2

I tweaked some things from the tutorial and I'm also including more tests to keep learning other OpenGL topics that were not covered by the tutorial.
